# Human-Pose-Estimation-Application
Here we have barely scratched the surface of pose estimation’s techniques and use.
We have made use of opencv, tensorflow module and basic posenet module.

There are 3 application we have implemented
1. Pose detection
2. Eye filter
3. Kids game

OBJECTIVES

● To identify, locate and track the key points of Human Pose Skeleton

● To use and apply the results of PoseNet with real life applications.

CONCEPTS REQUIRED

● Basic Tensorflow

● Python Programming
